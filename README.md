# Postgres-a-palooza
Used PostgreSQL and starter seed date to answer the following ...

1. How many comments has each user made per category?
2. Get a listing of all posts grouped by year.
3. How many comments does each user have across all of their posts?
4. Which posts contain a specific keyword?
5. Which category of post has each user made the most comments on?
6. Get a specific user's posts sorted by date of most recent comment.
7. Get all posts by a specific user that have comments, but which that user *hasn't* commented on.
8. Get the top 5 most-commented-on posts that were created in the last 7 days.
9. Get the top 5 wordiest posts (just by character count &ndash; don't actually count words).
10. Get all posts sorted by longest-running comment thread (time between first and last comments).
